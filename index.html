     	<h2>Your Window on the Universe</h2>
        <p>Hyde Memorial Observatory is, as far as we know, the only observatory anywhere that is: built, furnished and operated entirely by donations, devoted exclusively to public viewing, completely free of admission charge, and staffed only by volunteers.</p>
        <p>It is fully operated by volunteers, we feature views of the night skies through our three telescopes and hold a public astronomy presentation every Saturday night.</p>
